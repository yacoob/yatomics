# yacoob's aurora

_...or "yet another aurora" :D_

This is [aurora-dx:stable](https://github.com/ublue-os/bluefin/pkgs/container/aurora-dx/) with the extra packages that I like, built via [BlueBuild](https://blue-build.org/how-to/setup/).

## next

- wait for https://github.com/blue-build/cli/issues/263 and adjust `maybe-build.yaml` to use this information
